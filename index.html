	Hello there, my name is Justin Ng and I'm a student at UC Berkeley studying Economics. I emphasized my studies around economic analysis, but I also took various classes in Business and Statistics. My passions include playing sports, lifting weights, and gaming. I'm also a follower of investment opportunities in stocks and am working toward developing games. I coded this website from scratch to improve my HTML and CSS development skills.
