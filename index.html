	Hello there, my name is Justin Ng and I'm a student at UC Berkeley studying Economics. I emphasized my studies around economic and financial analysis, but I also took various classes in Business and Statistics. I'm a follower of investment opportunities in the stock market as well as global exchange markets. I coded this website from scratch to improve my HTML and CSS development skills, which will be used along with JavaScript to create my own web browser game.
